		This is 512 bytes of nonsense, since the Firefox 2 developers, in one of the strangest decisions ever, decided 
		they would obsolete XML styles by overriding them without permission.  Furthermore, the developers appear 
		to be disinterested in fixing this.  Therefore, we use the unofficial workaround, which includes filling 
		up the first 512 bytes of a document so that the sniffer doesn't encounter the RSS tag.  I really enjoy
		using Firefox, but this particular behavior really annoys me! Anyway, since I'm almost at 512 characters, I'm
